    # the purpose of getter and setters is that we have created functions that get and set attributes within a class
    # These functions streamline the parameter setting in a class so those attributes cannot be controlled from

    # Remember the objective of using getter and setter is that I could verify the attribute values if a user tries
    # to change parameters from outside a class
    # Using getter and setter enable control over
    # that object so that you can just trust that it's going to be correct as
    # designed Using a getter and Setter really just enables python to
    # automatically detect when you're trying to manually set a value
    # The equal sign and the dot as I've highlighted here is enough of a clue to python to realize
    # wait a minute you're trying to set a value let me see if this class has a
    # Setter defined and if so I'm going to call that and I'm not just going to
